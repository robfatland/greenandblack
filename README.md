# [Pretty version of greenandblack](https://robfatland.github.io/greenandblack/)


[This repo](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/main)
began as a Note To Self on simplifying format of the *Bourne again shell* **`bash`**: 
No colorized text, just green characters on a black background.


This page is the repository reference. To 'get to the point' you want to use one of the 
two links that follow:

- [the repo documentation branch `gh-pages`](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/gh-pages)
- [the resulting compiled documents](https://robfatland.github.io/greenandblack).


- the scope of the repo has expanded, as scopes will
    - some expansion is notional or stubby, such as material on containers and using `bash`
- this repo uses GitHub **pages** as a means of compiling content into documents
    - hence the **`gh-pages`** branch of the repo is where editable content resides
- customizing `bash` and `vi` is focused on green-on-black, a simple prompt, and text editing
- scope expanded to include
    - **`ssh`** tunnels from one machine to another
    - Difference: **`miniconda`** versus **`anaconda`**
    - Windows PC
        - **`Ubuntu bash`**
        - **`Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL-2)`**
        - **`VSCode`**?
    - containers
    - conda environments
