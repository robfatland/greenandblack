# greenandblack


[This repo](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/main)
began as a Note To Self on simplifying format of the *Bourne again shell* **`bash`**: 
No colorized text, just green characters on a black background.


This README is in the 
[**`gh-pages`** branch](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/gh-pages).
Note that 

There is also a [main branch](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/main).


The [documentation itself is here](https://robfatland.github.io/greenandblack).


The scope of the repo has expanded, as scopes will do. Now there are notes on containers, 
on bash-in-Windows and more.
