# [Pretty version of greenandblack](https://robfatland.github.io/greenandblack/)

This repo is a Note To Self on operating in the *Bourne again shell* **`bash`**. 
It began as "How to get rid of annoying colorized text: Just green text on a black background please."
This bias was inspired by Curtis Ling in 1985.
The meta-environmental spirit of the repo has now expanded: **basic information** on containers, bash-in-Windows and so on.
Use and or believe what you find at your own peril.


- Cool-format note: This repo uses GitHub **pages** so switch to the **`gh-pages`** branch to edit content
- Retro-customize bash and vi: Just green on black and a simple prompt
- **`ssh`** tunnels from one machine to another
- When to use **`miniconda`** instead of **`anaconda`**
- On a Windows PC: How are **`Ubuntu bash`** and **`Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)`** related?
    - ...and how does this in turn relate to **`VSCode`**?
    - ...and to containers?
    - ...and to conda environments?
