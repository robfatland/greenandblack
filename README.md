This repo uses GitHub **pages**. This README is within the 
[**`gh-pages`** branch](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/gh-pages).
There is also a [main branch](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/main).
A table of linkontents follows but is likely wildly inaccurate.


- Retro-customize `bash` and `vi`: Just green on black and a simple prompt
- **`ssh`** tunnels from one machine to another
- On a Windows PC: How are **`Ubuntu bash`** and **`Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)`** related?
    - ...and how does this in turn relate to 
[**`VSCode`**](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/gh-pages/vscode/index.md)?
    - ...and to containers?
    - ...and to conda environments?
- When to use **`miniconda`** instead of **`anaconda`**
