# [Pretty version of greenandblack](https://robfatland.github.io/greenandblack/)

This repository is a big "Note To Self" on fundamentals of operating in the *Bourne again shell*, **`bash`**. 
It started out as "How to get rid of the colorized text: Just make everything green text on a black background please!"
Insofar as this concerns meta- or environmental configuration, it has expanded into a collection of **basic information**.
Use/believe what you find here at your own peril.


- Cool-format note: This repo uses GitHub **pages** so switch to the **`gh-pages`** branch to edit content
- Retro-customize bash and vi: Just green on black and a simple prompt
- **`ssh`** tunnels from one machine to another
- When to use **`miniconda`** instead of **`anaconda`**
- On a Windows PC: How are **`Ubuntu bash`** and **`Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)`** related?
    - ...and how does this in turn relate to **`VSCode`**?
    - ...and to containers?
    - ...and to conda environments?
