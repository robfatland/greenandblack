# [Pretty version of greenandblack](https://robfatland.github.io/greenandblack/)

[This repo](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/main)
began as a Note To Self on simplifying format of the *Bourne again shell* **`bash`**: 
No colorized text, just green characters on a black background.
The [documentation branch (gh-pages) is here](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/gh-pages)
and the [documentation itself is here](https://robfatland.github.io/greenandblack).
The scope of the repo has expanded, as scopes will do. Now there are notes on containers, 
on bash-in-Windows and more.


- this repo uses GitHub **pages** so switch to the **`gh-pages`** branch to edit content
- customizing `bash` and `vi` is focused on green-on-black, a simple prompt, and text editing
- scope expanded to include
    - **`ssh`** tunnels from one machine to another
    - Difference: **`miniconda`** versus **`anaconda`**
    - Windows PC
        - **`Ubuntu bash`**
        - **`Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL-2)`**
        - **`VSCode`**?
    - containers
    - conda environments
