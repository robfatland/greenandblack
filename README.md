You are reading meta-content, specifically the ***README*** on the github pages branch of the greenandblack repo. 
The content (that is rendered pretty) is `index.md`. The pretty render is [here](https://robfatland.github.io/greenandblack).


# greenandblack

## Quo vadis

- The `lexicon.md` list of terms is relevant, needs a ton of work
- The file `index.md` is a compendium of useful recipes including the titular material on simplifying bash windows; more work here also
- What are the relevant related repos $R^3$?
    - `runawaytrain` has AWS Organizations and some API use; so very AWS-cloud-centric 
    - `reorganiseduponthefloor` has notes on `git` and some other possibly useful notes
    - `cbburn` does have some pandas DataFrame manipulation
    - `digitaltwin` is itself
    - `serverless` is itself
    - Left Off Here


[This repo](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/main)
began as a Note To Self on simplifying format of the *Bourne again shell* **`bash`**: 
No colorized text, just green characters on a black background.


This README is in the 
[**`gh-pages`** branch](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/gh-pages).
Note that 

There is also a [main branch](https://github.com/robfatland/greenandblack/tree/main).


The [documentation itself is here](https://robfatland.github.io/greenandblack).


The scope of the repo has expanded, as scopes will do. Now there are notes on containers, 
on bash-in-Windows and more.


- this repo uses GitHub **pages** so switch to the **`gh-pages`** branch to edit content
- customizing `bash` and `vi` is focused on green-on-black, a simple prompt, and text editing
- scope expanded to include
    - **`ssh`** tunnels from one machine to another
    - Difference: **`miniconda`** versus **`anaconda`**
    - Windows PC
        - **`Ubuntu bash`**
        - **`Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL-2)`**
        - **`VSCode`**?
    - containers
    - conda environments
