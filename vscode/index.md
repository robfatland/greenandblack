# vscode

[Visual Studio Code (vscode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
is an editor that -- while being less fun that `vi` -- arguably has better features.

The goals of this page:

- Describe vscode use in the context of this repository and in relation to **`git`**
- Articulate the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)


Incidentally WSL supports `vi`... so that's nice... anyway this is a stub. the end
