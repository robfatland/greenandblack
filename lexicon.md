Here are all the answers to all the important questions in the circa-2022 data science ecosystem. 
Well, some of them anyway.


## Weasel??? Anaconda???  What, are we in some sorta zoo????


This is an unapologetic sequence of lexicon explanations, an infinite sequence of paragraphs. 


### What is Anaconda?


Anaconda is a **Python distribution** that features a metric ton of pre-installed data science libraries. 
Therefore we can say Anaconda is a **data science platform** that happens to use Python. 
But when Anaconda installs in a Linux operating system it also installs therein this special command `conda`.
The `conda` command is a package manager; so if I need more libraries I can try and install them using
`conda`. This installing business sounds like `pip` and even `apt-get`; so what is the distinction
between the three? 


### What is **`conda-forge`**?


### What is Miniconda? 


### What is WSL?


### What is VSCode?


### What is **`bash`**?


### What is **`Linux`**?


### What is **`vi`** or **`vim`**?


### What is **`Jupyter`**?


### What is **`git`**?


### What is GitHub?


### What is Binder?


### What is an environment?


### What is **`environment.yml`**?


### What is **`requirements.txt`**?


I can "install" something called WSL... or maybe it is combined with "turning on Linux" inside Windows. But I can also install Ubuntu bash. Which opens a bash terminal in my home directory... where miniconda is not installed. So I install miniconda and now I can create and activate environments. And I can start a Jupyter notebook server. But the other day my Ubuntu <start> icon stopped working. So I forced Ubuntu to start using the Windows start utility. So it started. So I said "ls" and everything was gone. So all my hard work evaporated (except that it was mostly synched with GitHub so Hah Hah Hah on the gods of data loss). So 
  
  
  ### What is a web framework?
  
  
  ### What is flask?
